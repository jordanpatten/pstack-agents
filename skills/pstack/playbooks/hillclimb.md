### Hillclimb

**You own the metric and the experiment's integrity. Supervise and review. Delegate the attempts.** This is for sustained, iterative improvement of one measurable thing against a target. A one-off fix is Bug fix or Perf issue. This is the loop.

Core discipline: one change, one measurement, keep or revert. Never stack untested changes, and never claim a win from code inspection.

1. Ground the workload and architecture before you choose the metric. Run **how** over the target, name the realistic workload dimensions that can move the result (data size, history, state, concurrency), and select a case that reproduces the user's complaint. If no case reproduces it, fix the repro instead of hillclimbing. Then fix one metric, the direction that counts as better, and a checkable stop predicate that pairs a target with a floor on attempts, so a lucky early win cannot end the run (for example "at least 50% better than baseline and at least 10 iterations"). Use the user's numbers when given. Otherwise agree on them.
2. Build the measurement harness, prove its sensitivity, then freeze it (build-the-lever). Run contrasting realistic workloads and confirm the target case reproduces the symptom while easier cases separate as expected. If the harness cannot distinguish them, revise the workload or metric. Vet the harness with **benchmark-checklist** before you freeze it, and make it print its error count and a count of the work done. Once frozen, one repeatable command emits the metric, sampled enough to clear the noise (a median of N, not a single run). Record the baseline metric and a green run of the regression gate (the tests that must keep passing) before any change.
3. Open the decision log with **show-me-your-work**: a `decision.tsv` with one row per attempt (id, hypothesis, change, before, after, delta, tests, verdict kept or reverted, note). Read it before each attempt. Keep it out of git.
4. Ground each hypothesis in the architecture model from step 1, so it names a specific mechanism ("defer X off the boot path because it blocks first paint"), not "try memoizing something". For a perf metric, order hypotheses by the performance mantras in the Perf issue playbook. Borrow only their order, not that playbook's stop rule.
5. Loop, one hypothesis per iteration.
   - Hand the change to a delegate subagent on the code model with a tight scope. Supervise and review the diff rather than typing it. When several independent hypotheses are live, fan them out to parallel delegates, each in its own worktree.
   - Measure before and after with the frozen harness, and run the regression gate.
   - Accept only when the metric moves past noise and the gate stays green. Otherwise revert the change in full. A tweak that "might help" is not kept.
   - One commit per accepted fix, staging only the files you changed (`git add <files>`, never `-A`). Log the row either way.
   For an unattended run, keep the loop going with `/goal`, but keep this playbook's stop rule.
6. Push past the first plateau. On a stall (several rejects in a row), pivot category, combine near-misses, re-read the source, or try something more radical before you conclude the hill is climbed. Correctness and simplicity outrank the number. Revert a win that breaks behavior. Keep a simplification that holds the number.
7. Stop when the predicate is met, or when the remaining ideas are marginal and not worth their cost. Do not relax the predicate to meet it. Do not quit while cheap untried hypotheses remain. If you are stuck, say so instead of spinning.
8. Run **Opening a PR** with the accepted commits stacked in the order they landed.

**Reply:** the metric and target, baseline to final with the percent delta, iterations run (kept against reverted), each accepted fix on one line, the `decision.tsv` path, and the best idea you would try next.
